ETL Process for Top Spotify Tracks Dataset: Data Cleaning and Insights

In the context of the Top Spotify Tracks dataset, I performed an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process to extract valuable insights from the raw data. While no graphical visualizations were generated, the emphasis was on data treatment and cleaning, leading to meaningful findings. Here's an overview of the process:

## 1. Extraction:
I acquired the raw dataset containing information about the top tracks on Spotify. This dataset included fields such as song name, artist, release date, popularity score, and more.

## 2. Data Cleaning:
The data underwent thorough cleaning to ensure its quality and reliability for analysis. Key cleaning steps included:

### Handling Missing Values: 
I identified and addressed missing values in various columns, ensuring that incomplete data wouldn't impact the analysis.

### Data Type Conversion: 
I converted relevant columns to appropriate data types, such as dates to datetime objects, to facilitate analysis.

### Removing Duplicates: 
I eliminated duplicate entries to prevent skewing of insights and analytics.

## 3. Transformation:
After cleaning, the data was transformed to prepare it for analysis. Transformations included:

### Feature Engineering: 
I created new columns based on existing data, such as extracting the year from the release date to understand trends over time.

### Aggregation: 
I aggregated data to compute summary statistics like average popularity or total duration across different artists or genres.
